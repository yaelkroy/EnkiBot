Contributing to EnkiBot
First off, thank you for considering contributing to EnkiBot! We, Yael Demedetskaya and collaborators, welcome any contributions that can help make this project better, whether it's reporting a bug, proposing a new feature, improving documentation, or writing code.

How Can I Contribute?
Reporting Bugs
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Include details about your local setup and versions (Python, python-telegram-bot, OS, etc.).

Suggesting Enhancements or New Features
Open a new issue in the [Issues](<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>/issues) section.

Clearly describe the proposed enhancement or feature, why it would be beneficial, and if possible, suggest how it might be implemented.

Be open to discussion and refinement of your proposal.

Pull Requests
Fork the repository on GitHub.

Clone your fork locally: git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/EnkiBot.git (Replace YOUR_USERNAME)

Create a new branch for your changes, based on the main or develop branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name or git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix-name.

Make your changes.

Ensure your code adheres to any existing style guidelines (e.g., consider using a formatter like Black and a linter like Flake8).

Write clear, concise, and helpful comments where necessary.

Add tests for any new functionality or bug fixes if applicable.

Add and commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Follow conventional commit message formats if possible (e.g., feat: Add new weather provider, fix: Correct language detection fallback).

Push your changes to your fork: git push origin name-of-your-branch

Open a Pull Request from your fork's branch to the main EnkiBot repository's main (or appropriate target) branch.

Provide a clear description of the changes in your Pull Request. Link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").

Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments if requested by the maintainers.

Code Style
This project aims for clean, readable, and maintainable Python code.

(Optional: If you decide on specific tools like Black/Flake8, mention them here with any config details).

Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.

Write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.

Setting Up a Development Environment
Please refer to the README.md for instructions on setting up the project and its dependencies. Ensure you are working in a virtual environment.

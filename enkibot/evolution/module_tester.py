# === EnkiBot Module Tester (Placeholder) ===
# ==================================================================================================
# This module will provide the framework for rigorously evaluating evolved
# variants of EnkiBot's modules and prompts.
# It will be responsible for:
# - Executing tests in a secure, sandboxed environment.
# - Running benchmark tests for Python modules (e.g., unit tests, performance tests).
# - Evaluating LLM prompt effectiveness using frameworks like LLM-as-a-Judge.
# - Collecting and returning detailed performance metrics to the coordinator.
# ==================================================================================================

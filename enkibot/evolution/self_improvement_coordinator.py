# === EnkiBot Self-Improvement Coordinator (Placeholder) ===
# ==================================================================================================
# This module will serve as the central nervous system for EnkiBot's evolution.
# It will be responsible for:
# - Orchestrating the evolutionary loop: selection, modification, evaluation.
# - Managing the "Agent Variant Archive" of different EnkiBot versions.
# - Triggering the modification of Python modules and LLM prompts.
# - Recording performance metadata to guide the evolutionary process.
